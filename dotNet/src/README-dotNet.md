# Github Copilot Lab

Welcome to the Github copilot (GHCP) lab dotNet track!

There is no need to run the code in this lab, you can follow the tour and learn about GHCP. 
If you'd like to run the code, you can simply log the output to console and see if you've answered the question correctly.


Feel free to reach out with improvement suggestions, 
feedback, or anything that you may come up with to @Yomanor.
