# Github Copilot Lab

Welcome to the Github copilot (GHCP) lab Typescript track!

There is no need to run the code in this lab, you can follow the tour and learn about GHCP. 
If you'd like to run the code, you can do so by installing [Quokka](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode), then 
copy-pasting the imports (as the free version doesn't support imports) into the 
current file and start the server with Ctrl + P and then typing
`> Quokka: Start on Current File`. 


Feel free to reach out with improvement suggestions, 
feedback, or anything that you may come up with to @Yomanor.
